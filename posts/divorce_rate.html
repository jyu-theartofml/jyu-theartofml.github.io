            <p>I cringe when I hear people quoting the statistic that half of all marriages end in divorce. Not only it's an
              <a href='https://time.com/5434949/divorce-rate-children-marriage-benefits/'><u>outdated measure</u></a> from a time in the 80s,
              it's also a glaring example of how
              popular culture has turned a multi-faceted phenonmenon into a misleading number devoid of any nuances.
              When I came across the data set National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979[1], I decided to wrap those numbers
              into D3 visualizations for the marriage trend of the boomer generation, and to show that context matters.</p>
              <p>The patterns in these visualization are somewhat reminiscent of Eli Finkel's book <i>The All-or-Nothing Marriage</i>, in which he argued
                that American marriage has shifted from love-based to self-expressive[2], in an attempt to satisfy higher-level needs.
                As our society adjust to those changing expectations, he noted,
                <blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
                  <i>"The pursuit of self-expression through marriage simultaneously makes achieving marital
                    success harder and the value of doing so greater."</i>
                 </blockquote>

  <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>The survey dataset was collected from cohorts born between 1957-1964. The study
    follows the participants up to the age of 46, and tracks the marriage and divorce outcomes by age
  group, gender, race, and education attainment. The sample size was 7,357 people and 8,112 marriages during
the course of the study. The data used in the study is weighted to reflect the demographic representation
of those born in the U.S. during the period 1957-1964.</p>

<h2>Demographic trends</h2>
<p>Of all the variables in the study, I was most interested in gender and age at marriage. Although I suspect
  that those factors are correlated with education attainment to some extent.</p>
  <h3>Percent of first marriages ending in divorce</h3>
  <svg width="700" height="460" id="svg1"></svg>
  <!-- D3.js -->
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3-tip/0.7.1/d3-tip.min.js"></script>
  <div id="fchart"></div>
  <p>Across the board, women from the boomer generation have slightly higher divorce rates than their male counterpart.
  It's not surprising to see the probability of divorce decreases with education attainment. But the difference is
  more stark for men who have Bachelor degrees vs. men who only completed high school (25% points). By contrast, the different in divorce rate for women who has
  Bachelor's degree vs. high school diploma is 12.1%, about half of the difference seen in the male counterpart. </p>
 <p> The second bar chart looks at the effect of age at marriage. Here, the observation is in unit of marriage(not individuals).
 It shows the percentage of divorces along with the age at the start of the marriage, with a breakdown by education level.</p>

  <h3>Percent of marriages ending in divorce by age groups</h3>
<svg width="700" height="460" id="svg2"></svg>
<script src='divorce_rate/bar_total.js'></script>
<p>This barchart shows that the percentage of divorce is <b>below</b> 50% for cohorts who got married at age 29 or older.</p>
<p>While the likelihood of divorce trends downward with older age at marriage, there're some confounding factors. For instance,
age at marriage is directly proportionally to education attainment, so it's hard to attribute the lower divorce rates to just one variable (eg. education).
Having a Bachelor's degree or higher signals a significantly lower chance of divorce compared to those without a degree. The biggest difference is seen in participants age 29-34,
where having a bachelor's degree or higher means the chance of divorce declines by at least 17.2% compared to someone who doesn't have a degree. However, the <i>magnitude</i> of that difference
tapers off for cohorts older than 35. The older age group is more likely to have observation samples of second or third marriages, so another
confounding factor is the baseline likelihood of divorce in marriages after the first. </p>

</p>In this zoomable circle packing digram, the size of the inner circle is proportional to the percentage of people in that category.
The overall trend is that boomer women tend to get married much earlier than men, and through out their lives they go through more transitions
(as seen by the number of colored bubbles in each age group). </p>
<p> If we look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Fig.1), it is reasonable to map the migration of the lower-level needs to higher-level needs
in the context of aging.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As people become better educated and accumulate more life experiences, their expectations transition
  towards the top of Maslow's pyramid. According to Finkel, the desire for self-actualization
  goes beyond compatibility, it also requires a system of mutual support based on deep insights
  of each other's essence and aspirations.
  That kind of understanding through out the course of the relationship hinges on
  the investment of time and energy from the couple. </p>
  <p>Ironically, the average marriage seems to be
  getting worse over time just as the best marriages have been getting better.
  Divorce rate is declining, but only because marriage is becoming more exclusive to privileged groups[3].
