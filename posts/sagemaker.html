            <p>Recently I have seen AWS Sagemaker popping up a lot in the DS community. Out of curiosity, I wanted
            to see what the hype was all about, and how easy it would be to adopt SageMaker. This blog post is for anyone who
          wonders about the use cases for SageMaker and its advantages. </p>

<h2>When to use SageMaker</h2>

<p>In a nut shell, SageMaker(SM) is a cloud platform designed to quickly and seamlessly build, train and deploy ML models. The user
  can write and run ML/DL models, and SM will provision the necessary compute resources on the backend (e.g. EC2 instance, GPUs), and
  automatically spin up Docker containers. It's great for software developers and Data Scientist who don't want to be bothered
  with system configurations and want to focus on development of ML model[1]. Other reasons for using SM:

</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Scikit-learn models are fully integrated into SageMaker in the form of <code class='highlighter-rouge'>Scikit-learn Estimators</code>.
      <li> SageMaker Python SDK offers managed Jupyter notebook instance to support ML model training and execution. It also
        comes with APIs that support common Deep Learning (DL) backend such as Tensorflow, MXNet, and PyTorch.
      <li> Deployment to endpoint allows frictionless integration into other application stacks.
        <li> Endpoint object and model artifacts allow for efficient management and update of the model in a team environment.
    </ul>

      </figure>

<h2>The types of API </h2>
<p> The AWS document labyrinth for SM made it difficult to piece things together in a cohesive fashion. So I did some
  digging around and found some useful literature with clear high-level description. In essense, the API
  has three tiers: Amazon SageMaker SDK (high-level), AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), and awscli & Docker (low-level)[2].</p>

<p> The high-level Amazon SageMaker SDK is the most common, especially for beginners. It is hosted in a Jupyter Notebook IDE, and the user
  trains the model by specifying the instance types, and number of distributed workers. The SageMaker SDK will
  automate the training jobs and the subsequent deployment to an endpoint. However, SageMaker SDK does not work within an event-driven Lambda function, and that's
  where Boto3 comes in [3]. The Boto3 API requires that the source code be uploaded to S3, and specifying the relevant configurations. It has more low-level features
since Boto3 is the SDK for all of the AWS ecosystem. On the other hand, the awscli & docker API offers more ways to customize codes and system configuration. It's ideal for
 for situations where the model or algorithm you want to use is not supported by the SageMaker SDK.</p>
 <p> This blog post will focus only on the Amazon SageMaker SDK, because it's more user friendly and intuitive. By using the San Francisco crime dataset, I will
    walk through a straight forward tutorial on training a Xgboost regressor with hyperparameter search. I chose this after realizing that most SageMaker tutorials for xgboost are only for classifier, and doesn't
    offer more in depth details on the hyperparameter tuning API. </p>

<h2>Training with SageMaker</h2>
<p>To get started, head to the Amazon SageMaker Dashboard. On the left menu, select <i>Notebook instances</i>. To create a new notebook, click on
  <i>Create notebook instance</i> (see Fig.2). At a minimum, it expects an instance type of ml.t2.medium.</p>
