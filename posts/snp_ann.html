            <h1>Neural Network Classifier for Co-morbid Depression and Alcoholism </h1>
            <p>Recently, I read a paper published by my colleagues in 2013 titled <b> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3620932/">
            Genetic Markers of Co-Morbid Depression and Alcoholism
            in Women </a></b>. With DNA samples from 323 subjects in Austria, they profiled genetic variants known as Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), 
              and identified a collection of SNPs associated with Lesche Type III alcoholism in women[1].
            Since then, new Genome Wide Association Studies(GWAS) have shed light on new SNPs strongly correlated with depression. So I had the
              idea of adding these new SNPs to supplement those in the publication and build a classifier that can identify Lesche Type III alcoholism, which is defined as co-morbid
              Major Depression Disorder(MDD) and Alcohol Dependent (AD).</p>

<h2 id="Loci">Genetic Loci linked to Alcoholism and Major Depression Disorder (MDD)</h2>


<p>The scientific community has come to the consensus that MDD is a disease with genetic heritability in which many genes play a role, and its development can be
  influenced by enviromental and social factors. In the publication mentioned above, subsets of SNP markers on the same locus (position of a gene on a chromosome) 
  were identified as having significant association with type III alcoholism. A subset constitutes a haplotype block, and each haplotype was analyzed using Odds Ratio
 and p-value to evaluate the strength of association to the phenotype of interest(alcohol dependency + major depression). In August 2016, 
  researchers from Pfizer, Massachusetts General Hospital and 23andMe published an <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3623#t2'>
  articel</a> in <i> Nature</i> identifying 17 SNPs that are significantly associated with MDD in subjects of European ancestry[2].
  The study presented in <i>Nature</i> by <i>Hyde et al</i> was a breakthrough because past research studies could not 
  find genetic markers with significant and consistent association to MDD symptoms. One of the reasons was past studies did not focus on a select
  group of cohorts. As it turns out, genetic markers for MDD varied greatly for different racial/ethnic groups. I chose to include 
  the SNPs from the Nature article because it had a larget sample size (300K+ individuals for case and control) and their subject demographic (European) matched
  my colleague's study.
    </p>
            
<h2 id="data processing">Getting the genotype data</h2>

<p>To obtain genotype data (SNP variants) of the individual, my colleagues ran the DNA samples on Affymetrix' Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.
 It's a microarray chip l oaded with 906,600 prob sets corresponding to different SNP sequence, and the SNP variant is determined based 
  on the intensity of the array signal (Fig 1).</p>

   </figure>
  
<p>In my colleague's study, they excluded Lesche Type IV subjects due to potential confounding factors, and focused on the females
  because past literature found that Type III alcoholism predominanty affects female. After QC, the sample size for statistical analysis
  and logistic regression was 116. In building a classifier, I decided to include the male group since they made up 60% of the subjects,
  and I see that there's quite a few male subjects in the Type III group within this study(Fig 2). This brings the sample size to 293.</p>

<h2 id="Neural Network">Neural Network</h2>


<p>Using the cleaned-up dataset, I will compare model performance of Logistic Regression with Neural Network using the <i>Neuralnet</i>
             library in R. Neural network is a machine learning model inspired by neuronal activation and transmission of signal in the brain.
            I like to think of it as a fully connected network of 'nodes' that introduce nonlinearity to the weighted inputs by applying some kind of 
            activation function (i.e., sigmoid, tanh, ReLU functions) before sending the outputs to the next layer (Fig 3).The input layer 
  corresponds to the feature variables of the data (SNP features, gender class). For each node in the hidden layer, the dot product 
  of the input and weights are fed into the activation function. The nodes in the output layer corresponds to the number of classes. In my case, a binary classification (Type III or Non Type III) 
            results in only one node in the final output layer.</p>

<h2 id="randomeforest">Caret and the Forest</h2>

<p>After the data are preprocessed, I used the <i> Caret</i>  library to perform grid search with cross validation (CV). I chose 
<a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/21/random-forests-and-boosting-in-mllib.html">Random Forest (RF) regressor </a> because it is known to work well with nonlinear data, it selects random 
subset of features at each node split, and it reduces variance (aka: overfitting) of the model by having independent weak learner trees. </p>
<p>Since the trees in RF are independent of each other, it is easy to setup parallel computing.
This is helpful for running RF on large dataset with ~1M samples. On the <i> Caret</i>  documentation, the author only mentioned 
<i> doMC</i>  for parallel computing but that only works for Macs. I have a windows 10 laptop with 4 cores (8 processors), and found that
the <i>doParallel</i>  package worked well with the CV workflow.
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-R" data-lang="R">

                                  list = FALSE, 
                                  times = 1)
data_train<-datasets[trainIndex,]
data_val<-datasets[-trainIndex,]
#### grid must include mtry for RF model ####
rfgrid<- expand.grid(mtry=c(6,13))
set.seed(20)
cv_control <- trainControl(
  method = "cv",
  number = 3)
  
###### NOTE: CV and grid functions has to come before cluster computing setup  ##########

cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores()-3)# leave at least 1 node for operating system 
registerDoParallel(cluster)

##train function will invoke dummy variables for formula input!
##but randomForest library itself doesn't do that with formula input
rfFit <- train(log_duration ~ ., data = data_train, 
                 method = "rf", ntree=100,
                 trControl = cv_control, 
                 tuneGrid=rfgrid,
                 verbose = FALSE, importance=TRUE)

stopCluster(cluster)
registerDoSEQ()
## to see error of the model
rfFit$results
</code></pre></figure>

<p> Running the model fit on only 400K samples (to save time), the average validation RMSE was around 0.4135. There's still 
room for improvement, especially by running the whole training set. As you can see, it's easy to perform cross validated parameter
tuning on a Random Forest regressor through <i>Caret</i>, which comes with other widely used models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, 
and GLM regression, etc (total of 238).
