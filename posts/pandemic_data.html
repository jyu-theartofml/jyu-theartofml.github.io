            <p>In the span of the past month, the American public has been bombarded with numbers, charts, maps...and more charts on the spread of the Covid19 outbreak.
              While these metrics are helpful in providing an overview for a given region (e.g. county), the nature of the data and <i>how</i>
              they are collected makes it infeasible in coming up with accurate estimate or forecast of the infection curve. So it was surprising to hear that today Dr.Fauci
              changed the <a href='https://www.npr.org/2020/04/09/830664814/fauci-says-u-s-coronavirus-deaths-may-be-more-like-60-000-antibody-tests-on-way'>projection </a>of the U.S.
              dealth toll to "more like 60,000", which is a big departure from the estimate of 100,000-200,000 he made
              just 11 days ago. It makes you wonder how they come up with that projection at the Institue of Health Metrics and Evaluation (which was used to support Fauci's forecast).
            </p>
          <p> Let's take a closer look into the limitation of the data available and shed light on why they are not meant to be used for modeling or forecasting.</p>

<h2>Inconsistency in testing</h2>

<p>The biggest shortcoming of Covid19 data stems from inconsistent testing policies between the states. The map
  compiled by CNBC in Fig.1 shows the range of testing efforts by reporting testing per 100,000 population.
 The top three states are New York, Louisiana and Washington; the ones lagging behind are Texas, South Carolina, California and Oklahoma. </p>

   </figure>


<p>The number of confirmed cases depend on the number of people being tested, <b>therefore access to testing becomes a bottleneck in collecting
 data that reflects reality</b>. To compound the problem, some states have shifted back and forth in its testing policy, and that has
 resulted in backlog jams. A prime example is California, which is still working on its backlog, and has tested less than 0.5% of the state's residents at the time of this writing.
 In terms of public data released, there is no way to separate the backlogged test results from the other results. All of that means
 the number that gets reported is skewed as a function of resources and turn around time,
 and there is no reliable measure of incidence rate to get a sense of how fast the infections is spreading. Here, incidence rate is defined as
 the number of NEW cases that develop (or gets detected) in a given time period.
 As a result, media outlets can only report total number of cases and deaths in a given population.
</p>

<h2>Distribution of prevalence rate</h2>
<p>Most of the hospitalization rate and fatality rate quoted in news report are averaged estimate across the country or just a few states[1]. All of the demographic data released by the CDC
  are based on patients who tested positive and showed up at the hospital site.
 We know that older patients, and those with underlying medical conditions, are more likely to be hospitalized and have higher fatality rate.
However, any attempt to project hospitalization or fatality number at a given locality is thwarted by the lack of
prevalence data for the demographic group of interest. For clarity, prevalence rate is defined as this:</p>
<pre stype="text-align: center">
                           # of disease cases in sample
Prevalence rate  =  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                    Total # of people in sample
</pre>
<p>The public data set that I have come across are only reporting the numerator and not the denominator, which is the total number of people tested for Covid19 in the study.
Currently, there's no data gathered for the total number of people tested within each age group, or each comorbidity group. That is the missing link in estimating the numbers
on a granular administrative level, which has its own distinct demographic makeup that can vary significantly from the CDC study data. At best, only some state health department
are keeping track of the number of cases broken down by age groups.</p>

<h2>System vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>There is an thoughtful <a href='https://medium.com/@robertbracco1/the-ihme-covid19-model-is-dangerously-flawed-c19928464db1'>
  article </a>writtein by Robert Bracco on why the current model used by public policymakers is deeply flawed. One of the flaws
  is that the model does not take into account the increase of mortality rate for patients when the local healthcare system is overloaded (think Italy).
It is reported that the virus has recently started to spread quickly into <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/coronavirus-closures-could-ruin-rural-hospitals-medical-practices.html'>
  rural America</a>, where the population tends to be older and poorer,
and local hospitals have scarce resources to handle Covid19 patients. Some of the local clinics have already closed their doors, so it's expected that
mortality rate for rural population would be higher compared to its urban counterpart. And it doesn't help that there's currently 7 states that refuse to issue a stay-at-home order, creating a loophole in the containment effort.</p>
<p>Since testing is limited or discouraged for individuals with mild or no symptoms, it is uncertain if there will be a second wave of infection if the governement ease up on the quarantine.
  Until there are test kits readily available to the masses, the number of death cases serves as the most practical indicator of the impact and scope of Covid19.</p>
