            <h1>RetinaNet lung opacity detection (with meta data)</h1>

            <p>The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) recently hosted a Kaggle competition, where Kagglers are asked to 
              build a model to screen for marker of pneumonia by detecting lung opacity on chest radiographs. The standard practice for 
             diagnosis of pneumonia is time consuming - requiring review of radiographs by trained professional, vital sign, and clinical 
            history of the individual patient. The quality of the chest radiograph (CXR) also makes accurate diagnosis a challenging task,
           because the opaque features can be caused by pulmonary edema, bleeding, lung cancer, or fluid in the 
              pleural space (pleural effusion)[1]. To quote the RSNA:</p>
            <blockquote class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
                <i>"They see the potential for ML to automate initial detection 
       (imaging screening) of potential pneumonia cases in order to prioritize and expedite their review."</i>
            </blockquote> 

            <p>I tried out the <u><a href='https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet'> RetinaNet object detector </a> </u>
              (implemented in Keras by Fizyr) on the image dataset, but unfortunately ran out of time to submit before the deadline. For this 
              post, I will focus mostly on model performance and tradeoff associated with using meta data from the dicom image 
              files. But before going into that, I will explain why I chose RetinaNet.

<h2 id="background">What's special in RetinaNet?</h2>

<p>RetinaNet is a single-stage object detector proposed in the paper 
  <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002'><b>Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection</b></a> 
  by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, et al. In addition to having faster processing speed,
  it offers higher accuracy in small object detection compared to YOLO and even SSD [2], thanks to Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) design (Fig. 1).

<h2 id="preprocessing">Image Contrasting</h2>

<p>The size of the original dicom image is 1024x1024, which is too expensive for most deep learning models. Another issue is that the 
  RetinaNet model takes 3-channel pixel array (i.e., RGB). So in preprocessing the pictures, several steps take place. </p>

  <h3> Conclusion </h3>
  <p> With sufficient samplings, Bayesian modeling outperformed regular logistic regression fitting by a 
    slight margin in F1 score. Given the computational cost, it would be more efficient to apply probabilistic programming 
    to complex model with higher dimensions than the dataset used for the code presented here. Currently there's great interest
    in training models with Bayesian Neural Network that is capable of generating prediction/posterior distributions, and 
    yielding higher accuracy[3]. However, within PyMC3 there's been some issues with saving the model and the 
    trace file - when user reloads it to run on 
    new dataset it <a href='https://discourse.pymc.io/t/out-of-sample-predictions-from-a-pickled-model/956'> doesn't accept </a>
    the new data (i.e., failing due to broadcasting different sample length). Hopefully PyMC3 and other packages like Edward 
    would roll out improvements for more robust backend support.
